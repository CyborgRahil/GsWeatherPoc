Mobile UI
===============

 * This layer makes use of the Android Framework and is used to create all of our UI components to display
   inside of the Home Activity.

 * The layer receives its data from the Presentation layer and when retrieved, the received models are
   mapped using the Weather Mapper so that the model can be mapped to this layer's interpretation.
